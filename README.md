# MCMCtree forked

MCMCtree is a Bayesian MCMC program for estimation of species divergence times using molecular and trait data. MCMCtree was written by Ziheng Yang from University College London. This is a fork of MCMCtree with small modifications suitable for large-scale analyses. Note this version may lag behind Ziheng's official version. The latest version can be found in [PAML's repository](https://github.com/abacus-gene/paml).

## Installation

To compile the program go into the `src/` directory and type `make` (this assumes you are in a Unix-type system and with build tools available). This will compile the `mcmctree` executable. If you're planning on running MCMCtree in a high-performance cluster, it may pay off to check if dedicated compilers are available for your cluster's architecture. For example, for Intel clusters, the Intel compiler may be available. In that case, you may want to set `CC = icc` and `CFLAGS = -fast` in the `Makefile`, then compile with `make` in the cluster. Our tests indicate the Intel-compiled version of MCMCtree is up to 2.5x faster than the GCC-compiled version.

## Using the program

MCMCtree is run in the command line, with program settings spcified in a control file, usually called `mcmctree.ctl`:

```
$ mcmctree mcmctree.ctl
```

A simple tutorial is available in the `tutorial/` folder. A book chapter on how to run MCMCtree using phylogenomic datasets is available at [github.com/mariodosreis/divtime](https://github.com/mariodosreis/divtime).

## Control file

This sectiond describes settings in the control file for this version of MCMCtree which may behave slightly different than the main production version. Please do not assume compatibility with other versions.

```
seed = -1
seqfile = ape4s.phy
treefile = ape4s.tree
outfile = out
checkpoint = 1

ndata = 1      * number of partitions
usedata = 1    * 0: no data; 1:exact likelihood; 2:approximate likelihood; 3: prepare approx. lkhd files
clock = 1      * 1: global clock; 2: independent rates; 3: correlated rates

model = 4    * 0:JC69, 1:K80, 2:F81, 3:F84, 4:HKY85
alpha = .5   * alpha for gamma rates at sites
ncatG = 5    * No. categories in discrete gamma

cleandata = 0    * remove sites with ambiguity data (1:yes, 0:no)?

BDparas = 1 1 0      * birth, death, sampling
kappa_gamma = 2 .2   * gamma prior for kappa
alpha_gamma = 2 4    * gamma prior for alpha

rgene_gamma = 2 2   * gamma prior for mean rates for genes
sigma2_gamma = 1 10  * gamma prior for sigma^2 (for clock=2 or 3)

print = 1
burnin = 4000
sampfreq = 6
nsample = 5000
```

**checkpoint** activates checkpointing. If `checkpoint = 1` the state of the MCMC chain will be saved to file `mcmctree.ckpt` every 10% percentile of the total MCMC run length. Burn-in is used as set in the control file and states during burn-in are not saved. If `checkpoint = 2`, the program will resume the MCMC chain from the `mcmctree.ckpt` file. In this case the `burnin` variable is ignored (i.e., is set to zero internally). The state of the chain is also saved every 10% percentile. Note in all cases `mcmctree.ckpt` is overwritten everytime the chain is saved, and thus only the last state saved is available. This version of MCMCtree allows unlimited checkpoint runs, simply rename the `mcmc.txt` file once the run has finished and restart the MCMC chain. The varios MCMC files can then be merged into a larger file and process with `print = -1` in the control file. In short, use `checkpoint = 1` for the first run in which you need to use burn-in, then use `checkpoint = 2` for subsequent runs.
